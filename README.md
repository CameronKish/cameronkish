**`AI-Enhanced Financial Pioneer (Public Accountant/Software Developer/Innovator)`**

As a seasoned Public Accountant at EY, I've been dedicated to safeguarding users of financial statements by substantively testing significant accounts as well as ensuring significant classes of transactions are supported by a robust internal control environment. 

Simultaneously, my passion for technology has led me to embrace the role of a Software Developer. In this capacity, I craft cutting-edge solutions that seamlessly blend the worlds of finance and artificial intelligence with the goal of pioneering new technology in the realm of finance and accounting.
